To compare your results with reference tags:
  - generate results from your program to file of structure similar to "example_results.txt"
  - run Results_Comparer.exe set path to your results in "Results document" (double click in text field open file dialog)
  - specify path to "Individual" folder with original frames to enable image preview (in "image set" text field)
  - click "Compare Results"

Tags are not ideal, so you are can improve my tags using "Image_classifier.exe".
  - specify path to "Individual" folder with original frames to enable image preview (in "Path to all images" text field)
  - click "Load dataset"
  - Move to next and previous image by left and right arrow.  
  - Tag image using check boxes or numerical keys 1-5 ( num pad not supported so far)
  - click "Save tags" button.
